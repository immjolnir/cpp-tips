The repo can be found here:

K4DOS was built upon the shoulders of giants, and inspired by the following projects that proved valuable references and resources while I learned how to do this:

Kerla
https://github.com/nuta/kerla
Redox
https://www.redox-os.org/
Theseus
https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus
Aero
https://github.com/Andy-Python-Progra...

And many, many more git repos, StackOverflow questions, ChatGPT queries, and man pages.
